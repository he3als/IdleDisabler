## Warnings
- **Do not close the batch script using the red X, use the built in exit instead to prevent you from accidently leaving idle disabled**
- Disabling idle will most likely increase CPU temperature
- You should not have idle disabled constantly
- You could reduce CPU longevity if you leave idle disabled for long periods of time

## Features
- Automatically minimising (togglable)
- Quite fast
- Easy to use & easy to configure (configuration is done by editing the batch script)

## FAQ
1. **Why not just have idle disabled constantly?** It is simply wasting power, making your CPU warmer and reducing CPU longevity. You don't need idle disabled for browsing the internet, watching a video, etc... This script is made to prevent people from constantly running their CPU at C-State 0. You only may need this script whilst gaming and it is not recommended for laptops.
2. **Who is this for?** This is for people that want to make sure there's no jitter caused by their CPU switching clocks whilst gaming and for people who want to reduce latency.
3. **What even are C-States?** https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-uk/000060621/what-is-the-c-state

**Note: I have un-answered questions about disabling processor idle states within Windows and I will be adding to this FAQ once those answers are found.**
